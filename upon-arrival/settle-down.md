### Tips

* Most U.S. mobile carriers offer both prepaid and postpaid plans. Prepaid plans are typically more affordable and provide a variety of options; however, they require upfront payment and may offer fewer benefits. In contrast, postpaid plans often come at a higher cost but include additional perks and greater flexibility.
  * For AT\&T's prepaid offerings, you can explore their plans here: [https://www.att.com/prepaid/plans/](https://www.att.com/prepaid/plans/)
  * T-Mobile's prepaid plans are available at: [https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans](https://prepaid.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans)
  * For other carriers, please refer to their official websites for the most current information.
* Many carriers also provide family plans, allowing 3–5 individuals to share a single plan. This arrangement often reduces the average cost per line compared to individual plans. Specific terms and conditions for family plans vary by carrier, so it's advisable to consult the respective carrier's website for detailed information.
* When setting up a new line, it's common to visit a local store. A valid passport is typically required for identification. Be aware that SIM card sizes in the U.S. may differ slightly from those in China, so you might need to have your SIM card adjusted. If you're using an iPhone, you can opt to set up an eSIM at the store for added convenience.
