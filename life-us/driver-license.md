# Driver License



Q\&A for driver's licenses in Ann Arbor and the application process can be found [here](https://internationalcenter.umich.edu/resources/life/getting-drivers-license).

A driver's license is highly recommended since it’s an important self-identification equivalent to your passport. This means that you don’t need to take your passport with you in case of unexpected loss.

China is a non-treaty country with the U.S. That means you are allowed to drive in Michigan (and some other states) on your Chinese license if

* You have brought with you your Chinese driver’s license (translated version not necessary)
* You can show your proof of legal presence (i.e. have a valid I20)

You don’t need a Social Security Number (SSN) to apply for Michigan Driver’s License test, but you have to prove that you are not eligible for obtaining a SSN. You need to provide a **Letter of Ineligibility** from the **Social Security Office**. You should first bring your i20, i94, passport and your address proof (some letters with your room address are enough)

After you obtain your SSA letter, you could take the Traffice Knowledge Test, the related office is in Ypslanti, which you could go by No.4 bus. You should make an online appointment about 2 days before the test and for better preparation you could download the app "DMV Test" to learn some American Driving Law. Also be sure to bring the SSA letter, the i20, passport, i94, $25 cash and address proof with you to the SSO.

The Traffice Knowledge test is composed of 2 parts: 10 multiple choice questions about the traffic sign, 8/10 correct required; 40 multiple choice on basic traffic laws, 32/40 correct required.

After you finish your Traffic Knowledge Test, you are allowed to drive with someone who has a US driver license, and you could take the Road Test after 30 days (without Chinese driver license) or immediately (with Chinese driver license).
