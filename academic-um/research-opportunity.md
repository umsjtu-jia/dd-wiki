Although the websites offers a bunch of research opportunities, it's still pretty hard to join your dreamed groups via formal registering. Instead, read some of the Professor's paper and dig deep into related field and then contact the Professor via email might also be a great choice. Of course you could also ask you senior friends to recommend you to his/her own professors.
