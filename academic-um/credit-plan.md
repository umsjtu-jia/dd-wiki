# Credit Plan

## Credit Transfer

### Websites

For credits from U-M to JI, please refer to the [JI credit transfer database](https://app.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/equivalence).

For credits from JI to U-M, please refer to the [U-M credit transfer database](https://tcaf.engin.umich.edu/equivalencies/).

If you the course credit you want to transfer from U-M to JI isn't listed in the JI credit transfer database, you could initiate an application on [JI BPM](https://bpm.umji.sjtu.edu.cn/jibpm).

{% hint style="info" %}
Check your credit progress in both institutes every semester and plan ahead to make sure that you could graduate in the very semester as you wish. Take courses whose credit could be counted in both institutes would be a good idea to reduce credit pressure.
{% endhint %}
