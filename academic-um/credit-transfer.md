# UM Course

### Data Science Courses (Contributor: Haotian Zhang)

#### Fundamental Courses:

*   EECS 281 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

    Difficulty: 4.5/5

    A core DS requirement. It’s best to take this in your final JI semester or at the latest, your first UM semester. Delaying it will limit your options for upper-level courses. The course is challenging, with most of the workload in the projects. Exams are tough and require a lot of handwritten coding, so daily practice is essential. It’s strongly recommended to study key topics in advance (e.g., Dynamic Programming).
*   DATASCI 101 / STATS 250 / ECON 451

    Difficulty: 1/5

    These are basic DS foundational courses. While UM highly recommends DATASCI 101, it’s considered too basic by some. STATS 250 focuses more on statistical concepts and is helpful for future DS courses. ECON 451 covers similar material to STATS 250. It’s recommended to choose between STATS 250 and ECON 451. If all feel too elementary, consider petitioning to replace them with more advanced DS courses.
*   STATS 412

    Difficulty: 2/5

    A required DS course focused on probability and related calculations. It overlaps somewhat with STATS 250 but from a different angle. Not too difficult; recommended for your first semester at UM.
*   STATS 413

    Difficulty: 2/5

    The advanced version of STATS 412. Though the content is dense, the exams are relatively easy. Overall, not a hard course. Recommended for your second semester at UM.
*   EECS 376 / EECS 370

    These are core CS courses but are also worth considering for DS students in their first semester.

    * EECS 376 covers algorithms, cryptography, and overlaps with EECS 281. It’s practically a math course focused on foundational algorithms. Many CS students say it’s very interesting.
    * EECS 370 is useful mainly as a prerequisite for EECS 482 (Operating Systems). If you’re interested in computer architecture or plan to take OS, take this early.

#### Upper-Level Courses:

*   EECS 445 / EECS 415

    Difficulty: 3/5

    Both are upper-level DS requirements. Feedback suggests EECS 445 (Intro to Machine Learning) is much better in terms of learning experience. Personally, I found it one of the best courses at UM. Great professor, rich content, and outstanding students may even get to join the professor’s research lab. Since ML is critical for future research, it’s highly recommended for your second semester.
*   EECS 485 (Web Systems)

    Difficulty: 5/5

    A core upper-level DS course (can be replaced with EECS 484). Covers web, systems, and search engines. It’s a golden course for job hunting. Arguably the hardest course at UM, requiring fast learning of Python, HTML, JavaScript, etc. Projects and exams are tough. But you gain a lot—strongly recommended.
*   EECS 477

    Difficulty: 4/5

    An advanced version of EECS 376. A theoretical algorithms course that’s very helpful for students interested in theoretical CS. Heavy on math and advanced algorithms. You’ll need a strong command of basic algorithms going in.
*   MATH 565 (Graph Theory and Combinatorics)

    Difficulty: 5/5

    A high-level math course focused on graph theory and combinatorics. Ideal for those into theoretical CS or cryptography. Very tough, often taken by grad students, so choose carefully. But worth considering if you’re minoring in math or have a strong interest in the area.
*   MATH 526 (Stochastic Processes)

    Difficulty: 4/5

    Covers advanced probability topics like Markov Chains, Reinforcement Learning, and Markov Decision Processes. Strong balance between theory and application. Rich, engaging content. Highly recommended even for non-MATH minors.
