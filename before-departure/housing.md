## Other Tips

### Move-in and Move-out Time

Some apartments offer one-year leases, where the first month (Usually July - Aug) is counted as a “setup period”, and you cannot occupy the apartment during that period though you’re paying the “installation fee”, which is likely equivalent to your rent. Calculate your monthly living cost as the total payment/length of your occupation + utility bills (electricity, gas, internet, etc. Older apartments will have higher utility bills due to bad insolation). In the case of a one-year lease with installation time, the monthly cost is actually 1/11 of all the costs, not what’s listed on the website. Most student apartments (Courtyard, Willowtree, and apartments on central campus) charge installation fees, but more general focus apartments (apartments to the north of the city, usually outside of walking distance to the campus) offer monthly leases starting anytime.

### Rent and Extra Fees

Be aware: The leasing office often charges you fees outside of your rent, including monthly fees for drainage, management, garbage collection, etc.

Some leasing offices will charge extra when you change, terminate, or renew your lease. Don’t agree to the terms or payment immediately when they mention it! Most terms are negotiable, some might even be illegal in Ann Arbor. Highlights: You don’t have to decide whether to renew a lease until 150 days before the end of the current lease. You have the right to sublease.

### Rights and Duties

Read the [booklet from the city of Ann Arbor](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Documents/City-Tenant-Landlord%20Tenants%20Rights%20and%20Duties%20-%20FINAL.pdf) carefully
