## Other Tips

### Move-in/Move-out Time and Lease Structure

Some apartments offer one-year leases with a “**setup period**” (typically July–August), during which tenants cannot occupy the unit despite paying an “**installation fee**” (often equivalent to one month’s rent). To calculate your true monthly living cost, divide the total lease payments by 11 months of actual occupancy and add utilities (electricity, gas, internet, etc.). Older apartments may incur higher utility bills due to poor insulation.

Student-focused apartments (e.g., Courtyard, Willowtree, or Central Campus properties) frequently include installation fees, while general apartments (often north of the city, beyond walking distance to campus) typically offer monthly leases with flexible start dates and no setup fees. Many properties allow early move-ins for an additional fee; contact the leasing office via email as soon as possible to confirm availability and costs if you need that. _**Always verify terms directly with the property’s website or leasing team.**_

### Rent and Extra Fees

Be aware that leasing offices often charge fees beyond base rent, including monthly costs for drainage, management, garbage collection, and other services. Additional fees may apply for lease changes, terminations, or renewals. Do not agree to terms or payments immediately—many terms are negotiable, and some fees may even be illegal in Ann Arbor. Keep in mind that you are not required to decide on lease renewal until 150 days before your current lease ends and you retain the legal right to sublease your unit.

Always review contracts carefully and negotiate unclear or unreasonable charges. For clarity, consult the leasing office or local tenant resources before committing.

### Rights and Duties

Read the [booklet from the city of Ann Arbor](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-clerk/Documents/City-Tenant-Landlord%20Tenants%20Rights%20and%20Duties%20-%20FINAL.pdf) carefully
