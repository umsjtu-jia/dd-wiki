# Furniture & Grocery

## Shopping Platform 购物平台 <a href="#shopping-platform-gou-wu-ping-tai" id="shopping-platform-gou-wu-ping-tai"></a>

### **Online**: Amazon, Ikea, Temu, From other older students (wechat dd - group) <a href="#shopping-platform-gou-wu-ping-tai" id="shopping-platform-gou-wu-ping-tai"></a>

1️⃣ Price 价格 : Ikea >= Amazon >> Temu (美国的 pdd)

2️⃣ Reliability 可靠性 (买到假货、低质): Amazon >= Ikea > Temu

3️⃣ Speed (送货速度): Amazon (1 \~ 2 days) >> Ikea ( < 1 week ) >> Temu

🌟 It's recommended that you buy furniture and second-hand items from older students who are leaving Ann Arbor, but make sure you have places to store them until you arrive at Ann Arbor, usually it's a good choice to ask some senior students for help. 🙋

🌟 推荐购买从即将离开安娜堡的学长学姐处购买二手家具，但是请注意提前找好地方存这些买的东西，建议找认识的大一届同学的家暂时存储。(别忘了请这些学长吃一顿)
