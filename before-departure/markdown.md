## Luggage

Many airlines allow one free check bag for international flights, but the policies differ. Some of them allow two check bags free. Please pay attention to the **number of free bags** and **size requirements** to avoid check bag fees. Some airlines offer international student special tickets that allow more checked in bags.&#x20;
